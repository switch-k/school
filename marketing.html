<p> The online world has tremendously affected our everyday lives that sometimes it might even seem impossible to imagine our lives without technology and online communication. This trend naturally transferred to the business world, where the new technologies opened up so many exciting opportunities. The businesses out there were no longer confined by location or restricted by infrastructure. Once everyone hurled to the big cities because these have been places enabling your business to grow.</p>
<p> Businesses needed more qualified employees, they wanted exposure to more customers and opportunities to network and create partnerships. All of these required your business having headquarters in a big city, but this is no longer needed.  
Speaking of the business world, this term has so long been used in relation to big corporations and management teams, but nowadays, we see more and more one-man businesses that grow and expand their reach globally. There is a significant number of businesses completely set up and run by a single person. Or they start as such, only to expand as their influence online 
begins to increase.</p>
<p> Entrepreneurship has become a popular business model which helped so many wonderful business ideas come to life. 
The possibilities on the market are numerous, especially if we have in mind the online market. There are so many different ways and strategies to set up and grow a business, depending on the niche, resources, knowledge, etc. What is safe to say is that these opportunities are a part of the online world, and new opportunities keep popping up. One of those is affiliate marketing. </p>

          <p><h5>Introduction to Blogging</h5>
            
<p> Blogging has completely stirred up the situation on the internet. It has been something that people were getting used to during the 1990s, but as of 2000s, the online world completely changed due to the influence of blogging.
As more and more blogs started to emerge, so did the number of blogging tools. The approaches also began to evolve. We can trace the origin of blogging back to the online diaries published on the internet during the 1990s via dial-up internet. Over time, the topics of blogs started to expand. Personal blogs as a form of online diaries still exist, but many different types of blogs are now part of the blogosphere.</p>
<p> The number of blogs on the internet has been growing rapidly, as increasingly more people were gaining access to the internet and being able to create and manage their own blogs. Once creating a blog was an endeavor for which you would need to hire a professional, and you would also need training on how to manage and upload content. Nowadays, you can seamlessly create a blog within a few minutes without any technical skill whatsoever.</p>
<p> From the introduction of internet and the appearance of blogging to this day, a lot has changed.

Nowadays, blogging has become commonplace. It has become mainstream from the 2000s. Now people read blog posts every day. In fact, a large percentage of people own a blog (even if they do not have a habit of blogging regularly).
On the one side, we have the online community which has been relying so much on blogging as a source of information, entertainment, ideas, etc. People start following blogs they love and use them to keep up with the topic of their interest. They also interact with blog owners through comments.
Then, on the other side, we have companies. Most companies have one goal in common - reach online users. Due to the massive popularity of blogging and due to one particular search engine update by Google, called Panda (you can read more information on “Panda” later in this book), they have started to realize that blogging has to be taken to an entirely new level. Benefits of blogging are evident, but the craft (or better yet, art) of blogging is what evolved so much over the past years, that companies are focusing a lot of their efforts creating and managing content marketing strategy through blogging.</p>

        <div id="accordion3" class="accordion-content collapsed">
          <p><h5>Introduction to Content Marketing</h5>
 
<p> At this point, when we are all witnessing the overall presence of digital marketing, we can no longer neglect the importance content marketing has. It has become a fundamental part of any digital marketing strategy. It is a pillar supporting all your efforts and attempts to position your brand on the market and achieve your business goals. No longer can a business be successful and establish a relationship with the target group without some type of content involved. </p>
<p> It all started back in the 1990s. The internet was just kicking off, there were fewer people online. In fact, it has been estimated that there were 100,000 websites in total in January of 1996, as opposed to 1.1 billion websites we have today (Source). This was the time when even Google was still an idea and it was not even possible to imagine writing a status update or chatting with your social media followers. </p>

<p> In his essay “Content is the King”, back in 1996, Bill Gates explains the role of content in the modern world, and how the internet is changing the way we create, publish, distribute, and consume content. He predicts that the internet as a medium, which was then something new and different, will revolutionize the way people get information and the way they communicate. 
This was only an introduction to what was to happen in the subsequent years. As the internet spread all over the planet, so did the content as one of the ways to reach online users, to 12 

interact, attract, and sell. It started with websites presenting their business with a couple of web pages. This sort of static web presentation was then outdated, and the need to be more dynamic in communicating with the target group emerged. In the past, you could create a website and sit back, waiting for people to contact you. However, this approach is so obsolete nowadays, that in fact, it would produce zero results. </p>
<p> Today, it is expected from website owners to be active, to keep posting fresh information and to keep introducing new content. This is why a lot of websites have a blog. A blog is now a way to keep this dynamic approach, to be active and to make sure that new content is published regularly through this type of platform. Benefits of this approach are numerous, starting from gaining traffic, positioning for specific keywords to expanding reach through social media shares and obtaining new leads. 
There is no doubt that the role of content has evolved over the years, but so have the content types and production processes. Written content has evolved with new styles taking over, but the usage of visual content is also gaining importance, especially in the last few years. The concept of storytelling was also introduced as a more elaborate content strategy. 
The more content there is, the more important it is for the content to be extraordinary. It is as simple as that. There are so many websites online and so much content published each day, that it has become very difficult to make content that really stands out. To be successful at content marketing,  you need to go beyond content creation and think about management and optimization as well. With sophisticated search engine and social media algorithms, as well as email spam filters, content distribution is also facing some challenges. 
As the content has found its application in all parts of online marketing, developing a content marketing strategy has become an essential task and it is something that needs to be conducted very carefully with right goals in mind. </p>

<h5>Introduction to Email Marketing</h5>
<p> Over the past two decades, a lot has changed. The technology has advanced so far, that it has opened up completely new horizons. In terms of business, this means more opportunities and more ways to reach consumers. 
Online marketing is now a part of our reality, always included in the business plan, as a medium of improving business and realizing goals. Its potential has been proven so many times, that it is slowly taking over, leaving traditional marketing techniques far behind. It is estimated that almost 40% of the world’s population use the internet, and with this in mind, it is natural to think of the internet as a great place for advertising your business. 
Online marketing includes several types of marketing, and some of those are the following: </p>
<ul>


<li>•   • Search engine marketing</li> 

<li>•   • Social media marketing </li>

<li>•   • Content marketing </li>

<li>•   • Affiliate marketing </li>
<li>•   • Email marketing</li>
 
</ul>

<p> The main distinction between these types is the medium used to reach customers. Additionally, each type requires a set of strategies to be successfully implemented in a business plan. Best practices and guidelines are also something to have in mind when planning a strategy. 
Out of all the types of online marketing, email marketing delivers the highest ROI for marketers, which is why it is so widely used. </p> 

 
<p> About email marketing 
You should consider email marketing as a modern way of communicating with consumers. Emails, as a form of communication, have been around for decades, ever since the first sent email message back in 1971. Over the years, the World Wide Web has evolved and grown, and email marketing has found its rightful place in the business world. Although email messages were once a popular way of communicating with friends, online messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Viber, etc. have taken over this role. Despite this fact, emails are still important and a large percent of people do check their email inbox daily. 
This gives a high potential to reach online consumers. Email marketing should be a personalized approach, where your goal is to directly communicate with the online users in order to achieve something, such as generate a sale, get visitors, encourage downloads, etc. Even though an email marketing campaign is, in essence, a promotional campaign, you should go beyond this concept and use a more subtle approach to both reach and engage online users. 
The goal of email marketing is to get the message to the consumer, but it is not enough to simply send a message. You need to encourage open rates and you need to explore how the consumers are interacting with your email, whether they forward it, click on the links, etc. 13 

In this ebook, you will learn the basics of email marketing, optimization of an email campaign, how to grow your mailing list and implement email marketing in your business, all for the purpose of improving your business through this online marketing technique. </p>

          <p> <h5>Introduction to E-Commerce</h5>
<p> The internet has changed people's lives in numerous ways. From the way we look for information to the way we buy things. Nothing can stop the fast development of this immersion into the new technologies that we have now reached the point where we can no longer even imagine our lives without the internet. 
In such a reality, people are trying to adapt their lives and to get the best out of it. They want to improve their lives and become more efficient. Why would they go to the restaurant for dinner if they can order food in? Why would they spend time shopping when they can order everything they need in less than ten minutes? There is a constant trend to use the internet, not only to find out information but to get things done. 
Buyers and sellers </p>
<p> On the one hand, we have buyers, people who try to make their lives easier and better by buying online. Regardless if we talk about making a grocery shopping quick and easy, or ordering an item from abroad. The internet enables fulfilling those needs and the ability to obtain something you could not even imagine two decades ago. Besides convenience, online shopping also provides a great selection of products and services, as well as competitive prices. This is something that provides an incredible advantage over any local retail. 
Due to the growing expansion of the internet and the fact that new generations are growing up with the internet experience being part of their lives from the early days, the number of digital buyers is constantly on the rise. From 1.32 billion digital buyers in 2014, this number is expected to grow to more than 2 billion by 2020. 11 

The estimated number of digital buyers worldwide

On the other hand, we have people who create or simply resell the products through the usage of the internet. These sellers are turning to the internet as a tool to run their business and ultimately earn their living. Some are choosing the existing platforms specialized in the sale of goods, such as eBay, while others decide to create their online stores. Either way, the goal is to reach consumers and encourage them to buy. As a seller, your goal is first to reach the digital buyers, and then persuade them to buy from you, using a series of promotional activities, online interaction, etc. </p>
<p> E-commerce 
Buyers and sellers together make up e-commerce, short for electronic commerce. E-commerce is the transaction between a buyer and a seller, which is done through online technologies. It is the process of using the internet to buy or sell online. 12 

Despite the fact that e-commerce is something available to anyone and in spite of how easy it might be to start selling products and services online, there are many struggles to make this business viable and actually capitalize your efforts in the digital world. As the market gets saturated, day by day, it becomes even more difficult to place your products on that market. 
A modern consumer is overwhelmed with numerous advertising messages each day. He is also mobile, which means easy access to the information and ability to buy on the go. A modern consumer is also doubtful and equivocal. Faced with plenty of choices and alternatives, a modern consumer needs to make decisions on a daily basis. All of this shapes the approach of modern businesses whose goal is to reach that modern consumer and persuade him that theirs is the product they should buy. It is not an easy task, but with the right strategy and tools, you should be able to introduce and position your company on the e-commerce market. </p>

          <p><h5>Introduction to Web Analystic</h5>
<p> This course is going to help you understand the language of internet activity,and how to use different techniques, in order to improve your website’s performance and thus your business.Although web analytics is technical area, we will explore different aspect of this topic in order to establish its importance in the modern business world. 

The aim of this course is to provide you with the required knowledge on web analystic
Well, firstly we will be providing you with a basic understanding of what web analytics are as a language, and what big data is. Take any system as an example. Functions are connected to each other through modalities and mutually dependent arrangements, like the weather you see around you. To the layperson, the signs, signals or ‘language’ of the climate means little or nothing, but to a meteorologist it is gigabytes and gigabytes of data that can be analysed for numerous possibilities. </p>
<p> A similar example is music. If you are not literate in musical notation, watching Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony written down is just odd shapes and scribbling which is ineligible, without meaning, significance, and value or utility. However, put it in front of an orchestra conductor and it is a whole microcosm of mathematics and music in perfect symmetry that he can interpret and analyze endlessly throughout his life.There is a profound point to be made behind these analogies, and that is what brings us back to our book and its purpose: to make you fluent, adept and innovative when it comes to the language of web activity, conducting analysis of such activity (from here on referred to as web analytics) and make use of it in your commercial, organizational, social or personal sphere or context. </p>
<p> Along with this theoretical and practical knowledge, we will be providing you a history of web analytics, how it began to evolve from the first basic and rudimentary counters of visitor quantum, to the wide array of tools that open up the whole demographics of the internet to the web analyst of today. It was Steve Jobs, the late owner and founder of the ingenious Apple Corporation, who once remarked that in the future, only those who can read data will be able to cause change in what that data is measuring. 
So like a farmer who looks for information to analyze in the humidity of the clay in his fields, the moisture in the air, the formation of clouds for signs of rain, the resilience of pests or the life 9 

cycles of nitrates and other minerals necessary for agricultural flourishing- or even more so like the highly valued financial analysts who analyze market trends and the stock market – the web analyst is in essence an expert in cyber-agriculture.</p> <p> He understands how a website grows, recedes, why it expands and why it shrinks in traffic. He sees that what seems like lines of code or undecipherable data to the layperson, is an elegant and meaningful treasure trove of information that could make or break a website’s popularity, rankings and traffic. 
Lastly, we will be looking at the relationship between e-commerce and web analytics and why in today’s business environment it is essential to involve web analytics in understanding one’s business, making the right decisions and measuring the effectiveness of those decisions.</p>

          <p><h5>Introduction to Online Marketing</h5>
<p> In a world where every business has to fight for a share of the customers’ attention, marketing plays a huge role in boosting the number and interest of a company’s clientele. With the gradual increase in the number of small and large businesses that have sprung up in the last two decades, domestic and international markets have become saturated with suppliers, manufacturers and intermediaries, all striving to be the first ones to make it to the end of the chain. 
Until only a few years ago, marketing itself was a highly criticized concept. For many, it was nothing more than a waste of resources that could be spent better if they were invested in manufacturing and building of sales force.</p> <p> This sales-oriented approach makes businesses push products and services into the market, rather than creating a pull that customers would not be able to resist. 
Marketing manages to do just that. With creatively designed strategies and concepts, the promotional campaigns of goods and services slowly began to play an important role in the overall mission of a business, achieving sales targets as well as creating much needed awareness. Thus, the role of physical marketing became clearer and more defined. Today, a successful business cannot even think about producing goods and services without having an authentic marketing strategy in place. </p>
<p> Therefore, marketing is a business’s ammunition in front of a market that is full of choosy, precise and curious customers. It helps the business to answer questions, solve problems, present solutions and build long-term associations with the customers. A similar concept that has surfaced in the 21st century is that of online marketing. 
The move to a virtual world has been the result of the saturation of the market that has been mentioned here. With more and more businesses looking to attract customers, the internet became an efficient way to reach a large audience and to market one product or service on different vehicles and through different perspectives. Online marketing soon turned out to be a massive industry that today deals in billions of dollars’ worth of advertisements. 12 

However, just like many struggled to understand the importance and need for physical marketing strategies, adopting online marketing as a norm has not been easy for many old-school businesses. Since they have been functioning just fine with a brick and mortar presence, for them, online marketing might seem quite unnecessary.</p> <p>How can this perception be changed? What is it that marketers can do to create and increase awareness about online marketing? 
The answer is quite simple. Ask an average individual about online marketing; they may stop for a second or two to collect their thoughts before giving an answer. The concept of online marketing is not quite clear to people yet. While millions of businesses worldwide have jumped on the bandwagon of online marketing, not to mention the early adopters of this practice, a million others are still contemplating whether it is worth adopting. 
This e-book will prove to how useful understanding what online marketing actually is, and it will look at how this modern technique can help to spring a business up from being average to extraordinary. </p>
